<h1>HotCiv Implementation</h1>
<h4>By: Ryan Hankee, Chloe Lam, and Gwen Litwak</h4>

This Repositority Contains every variant of our implementation of the HotCiv game. By creating different variants of the game to continually implement the game, we were able to use the git branching commands to easily manipulate and expand our program without concerns for comprising any of the current functionality. White Box and Black Box testing were used to evaluate the accuracy of every variant in our implementation.

<h3>Differences in Versions</h3>
Each version of the game comes with its own set of rules and way to win the game. These requirements get more complex the farther along their name is in the Greek Alphabet, starting with simply allow the user to change turns, and finishing with needing to own all the cities placed by the opponents troops on the board. By Running ShowSemiCiv, you can run our final implementation of the project, where troups can move on the board, and use their abilitys to effect the game by clicking on the entity+shift.
